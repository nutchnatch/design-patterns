Keep a memento of an object's state to return to that state.

Motivation.
 - An object or a system goes through a set of changes (e.g, a bank account gets deposits and withdrawals
 - There are different ways to navigate through those changes
    - One approach is to record every change (Command) and teach a command to undo itself
    - Another approach is to save snapshots of the system and then allows user to go back to a particular snapshot

Description:
 - A token/handle representing the system state. Lets us rollback to the state when the token was generated. May or
 may not directly expose state information.
 - It typically does not have functions of its own
 - It is not required to expose the state to each it reverts to
 - Can be used to redo undo
