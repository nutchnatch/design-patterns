Motivation:
 - When component A uses component B, it typically assumes  B is non-null
    * When we inject an object,  we don't inject an Optional
    * We don't check for null on every call
 - There is no option to tell A not to use an instance of B
    * Its use is hardcoded
 - Thus, we build a no-op, non-functioning inheritor of B (or an interface that B implements) and pass it to A.


 Null-Object: No-op object that conforms to the required interface, satisfying a dependency requirement of some other object.

Description:
 - Implement the required interface
 - Rewrite the methods with empty bodies
    * If method is non-void, return default value for a given type
 - Supply a single instance of Null object in place of actual object

 * Used in unit testes or where you don want to pass the real object, but just an empty object creating a dependency injection
