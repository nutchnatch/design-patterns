This idea can be expressed like:
- Textual input needs to be processed, e.g turned into OOP structures
- examples:
  Programming language compilers, interpreters and IDE
  XML, HTML and similar
  Numeric expressions (3+4/5
  Regular Expressions

Turning string into OOP based structures is a complicated process and this is why design pattern exist

Interpreter: A component that  processes structured text data. Does so, by turning it into separate lexical tokens (lexing)
and then interpret sequences of said tokens (parsing)
