Facilitates communication between components by letting them be aware of their presence or absence on the system.

For example in a chatroom:
 - components may go in or out of the system any time (e.g, people in a chat room, or players in game)
 - Makes the sence of them to have direct references to one another (those references may go dead)
 - Solution: have them all refer to some central component that facilitates communication

Mediator is a singleton, because we don't need more than one instance to it.
Mediator engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components.
Mediator has function that components can call, for example can we please broadcast a message.
Event processing (e.g Rx) makes communication easier to implement.
