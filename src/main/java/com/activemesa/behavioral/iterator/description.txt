Describes how traversal of data structure happens and who makes it happen.
 - Keeps the reference of the current element;
 - Knows how to move to a different element

 Java has Iterator<T> and Iterable<T>
  - Iterator<T> specifies the iterator API
  - A class needs to be Iterable in order to support foo (Foo foo : bar) loops
  - Iterator cannot be recursive (no coroutines) - cannot suspend iteration
