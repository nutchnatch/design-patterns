Allows us to treat individuals or scalers components as well as aggregate objects, or collections of components. So both
of them can be treated in the same fashion.
Why do we want this?

Objects can use other object's methods and fields through two different mechanism:
- inheritance
- composition (objects contain other objects)

Ex: a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or
    a shape group made of several different shapes, all grouped together so when you drag them or resize them, you don't
    just resize one shape, but a grouping od shapes.

Composite design pattern allows us to treat both single and composite objects uniformly.
Usually, it is used to objects with needing similar/identical behavior
