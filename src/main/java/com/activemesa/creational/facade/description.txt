Expose several components through a single interface.

Example:
 - A house is a system that balance complexity, presentation and usability.
   Typical home has many subsystemm:
   - electrical, sanitation
   - complex internal structure (floors, layers)
   - End user is not exposed to internals

 - The same happens with software
   Many systems working to provide flexibility
   But API consumers want it just to work

Facade pattern aims to provide a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.
