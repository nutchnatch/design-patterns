Prototype pattern is all about object copying.
Motivation:
    - Copy structure from existing object, prototypes instead of creating it from scratch
    - Do a deep copy with all the reference objects
    - Cloning must be convenient, cannot affect the original object

Cloneable is not recommended to deeply copy an object, because clone method does not specify what it does. For deep copy,
other mechanism can be taken into consideration.
