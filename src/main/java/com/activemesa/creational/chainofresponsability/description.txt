## Command Query Separation
   - Command = asking for an action or change (e.g, please set your attack value to 2)
   - Query = asking for information (e.g, please give me your attack value)
   - CQS = having separate means of sending commands and queries to e.g,

   Instead of directly accessing a field of a particular class. In this case, we send it a message through a command.
   With the chain of responsibility, we can have other listeners to this this command being sent and they can override
   the behavior of the command or the query.
