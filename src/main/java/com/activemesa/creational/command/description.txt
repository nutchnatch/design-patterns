Ordinary Java statements are perishable
    - meaning that cannot undo a field assignment
    - cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls)

What we really want is an object that represents an operation

It is very used on:
    - GUI commands
    - multi-level undo/redo
    - macro recording


Concept:
- It is an object or a group of objects that represents an instruction that performs a particular action. It contains
all information necessary for the action to be performed.
