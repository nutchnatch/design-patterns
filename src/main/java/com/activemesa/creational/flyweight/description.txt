Avoid redundancy when storing data.
Ex:
 - In a computer online game, we may find a lot of users with identical first/last names,
 so, there is no sense to store the first/last names over and over again
 Solution - save those names somewhere else and add pointers to those names

 - bold italic text in the console, we want to format individual characters, we don't want to add additional information
 per character
 Solution - operate on ranges (e.g line number, start/end position)

 This pattern is used to space optimization technique that let us use less memory by storing externally data associated
 with similar objects.

 -> Store common data externally
    Specify an index or a reference into the external data store
    Define the idea if ranges on a homogeneous collections and store data related to those ranges.
